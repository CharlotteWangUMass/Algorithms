// Tree Traversal: is known as Tree Search. Each node in the tree is visited only once.
// Pre-Order Traversal: current node is supposed to be visited in each recursion step. (currentNode-->leftChild-->rightChild).
// In-Order Traverdal: current node is supposed to be visited in the middle. (leftChild-->currentNode-->rightChild).
// Post-Order Traversal: current node is supposed to be visited after visiting leftChild and rightChild. (leftChild-->rightChild-->currentNode).

// Pre-Order Traversal: Implementation in Java.
