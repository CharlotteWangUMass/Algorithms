// Stack: a logical concept. (like a box or bottom-sealed container).
// LIFO in stack: last in, first out.
// Usages: mainly in three problems.
// All operations available in stack: push(), pop(), top().
// Stack Implementation: array, vector.
// Problem-1: How to implement a queue by using two stacks? (queue.size == n)
// Solution: LIFO -> FIFO.
// Step1: push all the elements into the first stack.
// Step2: pop all the elements in the first stack and push them into the second stack.
// Time Complexity: pop(), push().
// Time Complexity of pop()
// Time Complexity of push()



// Space Complexity:
