// Binary Search: also known as half-interval search/logarithm search, is a search algorithm that finds target value in a sorted array or elements share same attributes in an array.
// In each step, make sure the given up part does not contain target value.
// The way to analyze Time Complexity/Space Complexity is to use recursion tree.
// Implementation in Java.
